# Flutter Client SDK for OpenIM 👨‍💻💬

Use this SDK to add instant messaging capabilities to your Flutter app. By connecting to a self-hosted [OpenIM](https://www.openim.online/) server, you can quickly integrate instant messaging capabilities into your app with just a few lines of code.


The underlying SDK core is implemented in [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core). Using [gomobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile), it can be compiled into an AAR file for Android integration. Android interacts with the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core) through JSON, and the SDK exposes a re-encapsulated API for easy usage. In terms of data storage, Android utilizes the SQLite layer provided internally by the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core).

The underlying SDK core is implemented in [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core). Using [gomobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile), it can be compiled into an XCFramework for iOS integration. iOS interacts with the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core) through JSON, and the SDK exposes a re-encapsulated API for easy usage. In terms of data storage, iOS utilizes the SQLite layer provided internally by the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core).

Based on the above AAR and XCFramework packages, the IM SDK for Flutter is encapsulated through the Flutter plug-in.

## Documentation 📚

Visit [https://docs.openim.io/](https://docs.openim.io/) for detailed documentation and guides.

For the SDK reference, see [https://docs.openim.io/sdks/quickstart/flutter](https://docs.openim.io/sdks/quickstart/flutter).

## Installation 💻
### Adding Dependencies
```dart
  flutter_openim_sdk: lastest
```

## Usage 🚀

The following examples demonstrate how to use the SDK.
### Importing the SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter_openim_sdk/flutter_openim_sdk.dart';
```
### Initialize
```
final success = await OpenIM.iMManager.initSDK(
  platform: 0,   // Platform, referring to the IMPlatform class.
  apiAddr: "",   // SDK's API interface address.
  wsAddr: "",    // SDK's WebSocket address.
  dataDir: "",   // Data storage path. For example, you can use getApplicationDocumentsDirectory() to get a path.
  logLevel: 6,   // Log level (default value is 6).
  listener: OnConnectListener(
    onConnectSuccess: () {
      // Successfully connected to the server.
    },
    onConnecting: () {
      // Connecting to the server, suitable for showing a "Connecting" status on the UI.
    },
    onConnectFailed: (code, errorMsg) {
      // Failed to connect to the server, you can notify the user that the current network connection is not available.
    },
    onUserSigExpired: () {
      // User's login token (UserSig) has expired, prompting the user to log in again with a new token.
    },
    onKickedOffline: () {
      // The current user has been kicked offline, and you can prompt the user to log in again with a message like "You have been logged in on another device. Do you want to log in again?"
    },
  ),
);

```
### Logging In and Listening for Connection Status

> Note1: You need to [deploy](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server#rocket-quick-start) OpenIM Server first, the default port of OpenIM Server is 10001, 10002.  
> Note2: You need to set up the listeners first and then log in.


```dart
// Set listener
    OpenIM.iMManager
      //
      ..userManager.setUserListener(OnUserListener(
      ))
      // Add message listener (remove when not in use)
      ..messageManager.setAdvancedMsgListener(OnAdvancedMsgListener(
      ))

      // Set up message sending progress listener
      ..messageManager.setMsgSendProgressListener(OnMsgSendProgressListener(
      ))
      ..messageManager.setCustomBusinessListener(
      )
      // Set up friend relationship listener
      ..friendshipManager.setFriendshipListener(OnFriendshipListener(
      ))

      // Set up conversation listener
      ..conversationManager.setConversationListener(OnConversationListener(
      ))

      // Set up group listener
      ..groupManager.setGroupListener(OnGroupListener(
      ));

// Retrieve the profile of the currently logged-in user
final userInfo = await OpenIM.iMManager.login(
      userID: "", // userID is obtained from your own business server
      token: "", // The token should be acquired by your business server by exchanging with OpenIM server based on a secret key
    );

```

To log into the IM server, you need to create an account and obtain a user ID and token. Refer to the [access token documentation](https://doc.rentsoft.cn/restapi/userManagement/userRegister) for details.

### Receiving and Sending Messages 💬

OpenIM makes it easy to send and receive messages. By default, there is no restriction on having a friend relationship to send messages (although you can configure other policies on the server). If you know the user ID of the recipient, you can conveniently send a message to them.

```dart
//Send
 OpenIM.iMManager.messageManager.sendMessage(
            message: await OpenIM.iMManager.messageManager.createTextMessage(
              text: 'hello openim',
            ),
            userID: userID
          ).catchError((error, _){
          // Message sent successfully ✉️	

         } )
        .whenComplete(() {
 	  // Failed to send message ❌

         });

//Receive
OpenIM.iMManager.messageManager.setAdvancedMsgListener(OnAdvancedMsgListener(
        onRecvNewMessage:(Message msg) {
     	// Received new message 📨

	  }
      ))
```
